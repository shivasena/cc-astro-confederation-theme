<div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto py-12 px-4 space-y-16">
  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h1 class="text-h1">Primary Heading (H1)</h1>
    <p class="text-p">
      This paragraph follows an H1 heading. It demonstrates the visual
      relationship between your largest heading and body text. A good
      typographic hierarchy helps guide readers through your content effectively
      while maintaining readability across different screen sizes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-h2">Secondary Heading (H2)</h2>
    <p class="text-p">
      H2 headings are ideal for major section breaks within your content. This
      paragraph shows how body text pairs with your second-level heading. Notice
      how the size difference creates visual hierarchy while remaining
      proportional and balanced.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h3 class="text-h3">Tertiary Heading (H3)</h3>
    <p class="text-p">
      H3 headings work well for subsections and important points. This
      accompanying paragraph demonstrates how your tertiary headings relate to
      standard body text. The contrast should be noticeable but not as dramatic
      as with higher-level headings.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h4 class="text-h4">Fourth Level Heading (H4)</h4>
    <p class="text-p">
      H4 headings provide further content organization for more detailed
      information. This paragraph shows the relationship between your
      fourth-level heading and normal paragraph text. At this level, the heading
      should still stand out while beginning to approach the text size.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h5 class="text-h5">Fifth Level Heading (H5)</h5>
    <p class="text-p">
      H5 headings are typically used for minor sections or callouts. This
      paragraph demonstrates how your fifth-level heading pairs with standard
      body text. The visual distinction becomes more subtle at this level, often
      relying on weight differences rather than dramatic size changes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h6 class="text-h6">Sixth Level Heading (H6)</h6>
    <p class="text-p">
      H6 headings represent your smallest heading size, useful for small details
      or specialized content. This paragraph shows how your smallest heading
      relates to normal paragraph text. At this level, the distinction is often
      minimal, with perhaps only font weight differentiating the heading.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <p class="text-quote italic">
      This is an example of a blockquote or featured text using the quote
      typography style. It should stand out from regular paragraphs while
      maintaining harmony with the overall typographic system.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <p class="text-p">
      This is a standard paragraph (<span class="font-mono text-sm">text-p</span
      >) demonstrating your base text style. It should be highly readable and
      comfortable for extended reading.
    </p>
    <p class="text-small">
      This is small text (<span class="font-mono text-xs">text-small</span>)
      which might be used for captions, footnotes, or supplementary information.
